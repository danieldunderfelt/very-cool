Welcome, weary traveler, to verycool.tech! This is the launch post, so yeah, we're quite young. And when I say "we", I mean me. There's only one of me so far. I am Daniel Dunderfelt, creator, editor and first contributor to verycool.tech. It's an honor to make your acquaintance!

Verycool.tech covers exciting developments in technology, mostly from the consumer point of view. Expect news about cool new gadgets, cool scientific developments, cool new games, cool... well, whatever I damn well want to write about.

I want to keep the site simple, so there'll be one column of news in chronological order on the front page, click an item and boom, you're reading the article. There will also be shorter messages for hot takes and quick updates that resemble tweets. Each article and message will be tagged by a handful of tags. Click a tag to read other similarly-tagged content. Click the logo to get back to the front page at any time. It's very simple and it will be kept it that way.

"But Daniel" - you say - "there's a lot of tech news sites out there already! Why are you doing this??". That's a very good question that I don't have a direct answer to, other than that I want to. I'm pretty into all things tech, so if I'm gonna write about something it might as well be tech. I might even have an interesting opinion or take on things rumbling around in my brain that you might not find elsewhere. I say that partly due to the fact that I don't write anywhere else, and partly because I like to think that I can write from a somewhat unique and interesting point of view, but you'll be the judge of that.

That's a nice segway into the next thing - how will I know that you find what I write interesting? Well, the answer is simple: analytics. There's a bunch of website analytics services out there that promise to track my visitor's every living breath, and while they'll surely say otherwise, they'll use that info to serve you ads. That's not cool with me. What is VERY COOL however is privacy! That's why I went through the trouble to install [Fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/) on my own server. Fathom is an open-source analytics tool that doesn't track much more than pageviews and referrers and it is especially uninterested in what you had for breakfast. It'll tell me how many visitors I have, where they came from and what they read... and that's about it. You're welcome.

Speaking of ads, yes there will be ads on verycool.tech at some point. While it is very much a side-project for me, I'd still like it to be monetisized if not profitable. I haven't yet given a thought about which ad service I'll be using, but it will follow a very privacy-focused path as well. I'll put an update post when it happens. If I get any readers at all, that is.

There's still a bit of work to be done for version 1, and I'll keep building the site beyond that. But for now I just wanted to launch and start writing articles! If you have any ideas or news tips send me an email on editor@verycool.tech.

See you in the next article!
