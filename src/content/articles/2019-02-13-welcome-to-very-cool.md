Welcome, weary traveler, to verycool.tech! This is the launch post, so yeah, we're quite young. And when I say "we", I mean me. There's only one of me so far. I am Daniel Dunderfelt, creator, editor and first contributor to verycool.tech. It's an honor to make your acquaintance!

Verycool.tech covers exciting developments in technology, mostly from the consumer point of view. Expect news about cool new gadgets, cool scientific developments, cool new games, cool... well, whatever I damn well want to write about! For now the content will be heavily biased towards what I personally find interesting, but feel free to suggest topics or send me tips on editor@verycool.tech. I'm also planning to bring on board other writers at some point, but let's see how this goes.

"But Daniel", you say, "there's a lot of tech news sites out there already! Why are you doing this?". That's a very good question that I don't have a direct answer to, other than that I want to. I'm pretty into all things tech, so if I'm gonna write about something it might as well be that. I might even have an interesting opinion or take on things that you might not find elsewhere. I say that partly due to the fact that I don't write anywhere else, and partly because I like to think that I have a unique and interesting perspective on important matters such as very cool tech things. But you'll be the judge of that.

Privacy is a very cool thing and something I take very seriously. That's why I'm running [Fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/) on my own server for this site. Fathom only counts page views and logs referrers, so I'll know how many visitors I get and which pages they visit, but nothing specific about them. Exactly how website analytics should be. Fathom sets a cookie with a random identifier that refreshes every 30 minutes, just so your session will not be counted twice if you refresh the page. The cookie does not track you around the web and contains no personally identifiable information. If you want to opt out, just enable the "do not track" setting in your browser.

It is very early days, but I do plan to have ads and sponsored content if things work out well enough. I haven't yet chosen an ad provider, but rest assured that my choice will be equally privacy-focused as my web analytics. Sponsored content will be loudly and proudly marked as such.

I really hope you will enjoy verycool.tech! I plan to create new content many times a wekk, if not daily, so do check back often. If you have any feedback, ideas or news tips you can always reach me on editor@verycool.tech. I'd love to hear about it!

See you in the next article!
