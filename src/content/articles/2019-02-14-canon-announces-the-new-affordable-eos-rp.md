ingress: "It is here: the full frame mirrorless digital camera for the enthusiastic amateur. At $1299 it is the most affordable full frame camera yet, and that price is the coolest spec about it. I'm personally in the dead center of the target audience for this camera, and to say I'm excited to see it announced after all these leaks is an understatement."

I'm a developer by day, and my hobbies include programming sideprojects, coding fun stuff and getting better at developing software. And writing articles for verycool.tech of course.

But when I'm not doing those things, photography is a huge interest of mine. I've owned traditional DSLR's, but it has always been APS-C models with a 1.6x crop. That might just change, as Canon released the natural upgrade step for someone like me: the EOS RP, a full frame mirrorless camera. For \$1299. Yes Canon, you have my attention!

That price is what makes the EOS RP _very cool_, but to hit that price point Canon has had to make some sacrifices. There's still no In-Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) to be seen, but I hear Canon is working on it. The 4K video feature has a very harsh 1.74x crop and it is limited to 24 frames per second. Further, the viewfinder is smaller and has a lower resolution compared to the R, and the same goes for the back screen.

There are also some smaller things missing like the manual focus assist which I thought looked _very cool_ in the EOS R, and I'm quite sad about that. It will also only do 8-bit video and has no C-Log, but I actually don't care about those things as I'm not really a video guy. Someone somewhere is probably quite angry about them being absent.

For the price, which again, is \$1299, you get a very competent full frame camera and it definitely makes the drawbacks palatable. You also get access to the growing library of Canon RF lenses. They won't come as cheap, but hey, you saved a lot on the body.

I won't go through all the specs and drawbacks in minute detail, but here's highlights of the EOS RP:

- 26MP full-frame sensor
- Digic 8 processor
- Dual Pixel CMOS AF with 4779 selectable AF points and 88% horizontal coverage
- 4K video at 24fps (again, with the crop though...)
- 1080p video at 60fps
- ISO range of 100-40000, extendable to 50-102400 (I hear it's quite grainy after 12000 or so)
- Fully articulated 3" screen with 1,040,000 dots (lower than the R)
- Electronic viewfinder with 2,360,000 dots (also lower and smaller than the R)
- A weight of only 485 g including batteries
- Did I tell you it costs \$1299? Sure, it's a bit more here in the eurozone but it's still the most affordable full-frame camera you'll find.
