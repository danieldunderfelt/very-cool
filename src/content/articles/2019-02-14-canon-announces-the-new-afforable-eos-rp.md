I'm a developer by day, and my hobbies include programming sideprojects, coding fun stuff and getting better at developing software. And writing articles for verycool.tech of course.

But when I'm not doing those things, or when I'm not busy with my day job, photography is a huge interest of mine. I've used traditional DSLR's, but it has always been APS-C models with a 1.6x crop. That might just change, as Canon released the natural upgrade step for someone like me: the EOS RP, a FULL FRAME mirrorless camera. For $1299. Yes Canon, you have my attention!

That price is what makes the EOS RP *very cool*, but to hit that price point Canon has had to make some sacrifices. There's still no In-Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) to be seen, but I hear Canon is working on it. The 4K video feature has a very harsh 1.74x crop and it is limited to 24 frames per second.

There are also some smaller things missing like the manual focus assist which I thought looked *very cool* in the EOS R, and I'm quite sad about that. It will also only do 8-bit video and has no C-Log, but I actually have no clue what those things do as I'm not a video nerd. Someone somewhere is probably quite angry about these being gone.

And... that's about it for the drawbacks! For the price, which again, is $1299, you get a very competent full frame camera and access to the growing library of Canon RF lenses. They won't come as cheap, but hey, you saved a lot on the body.

Spec highlights of the EOS RP:

- 26MP full-frame sensor
- Digic 8 processor (tbh I'm not sure how good this is if it has to crop the sensor for 4K video, but it's the best Canon has)
- Dual Pixel CMOS AF with 4779 selectable AF points and 88% horizontal coverage
- 4K video at 24fps (again, with the crop though...)
- 1080p video at 60fps
- ISO range of 100-40000, extendable to 50-102400 (I hear it's quite grainy after 10000 or so)
- Fully articulated 3" screen with 1,040,000 dots
- Electronic viewfinder with 2,360,000 dots
- A weight of only 485 g including batteries
- Did I tell you it costs $1299? Sure, it's a bit more here in the eurozone but it's still the most affordable full-frame camera you'll find.
