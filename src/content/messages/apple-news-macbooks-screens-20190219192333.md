What's cooler than 4K? 6K, that's what! There's a pile of Apple rumours going around that not only speak of new iPhones, iPads and larger MacBooks, but new Apple screens too that go all the way to 6K. The rumored size of 31.6 is very impressive and would give it a "retina" pizel density of a bit over 200.
