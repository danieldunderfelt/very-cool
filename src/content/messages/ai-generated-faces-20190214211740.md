This is trippy - [visit this site](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) and you'll see a picture of a person. That person does not exist, the picture is generated by a machine. It's not perfect and some pics may look weird, but we're one step closer to machines not only taking over, but looking like us while they do it.
